# Cytoscape_input_generator


This program gets interaction data as input and using both SAINTexpress, Omics Integrator and gprofiler, it both annotates significantly interacting proteins and generate cytoscape input files. Since SAINTExpress and Omics Integrator works only in Linux operating system, unfortunately, the code also works only in Linux operating system. You shouldn't try to run it in Windows or Mac operating system. 

3 programs are required for getting both interactome map and GO annotation graphs. These are SAINTExpress, OmicsIntegrator, and Cytoscape.
