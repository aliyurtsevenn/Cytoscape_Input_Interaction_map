# Cytoscape_input_generator


This program gets interaction data as input and using both SAINTexpress, OmicsIntegrator and gprofiler, it both annotates the significantly interacting proteins and give cytoscape input files as result. Also, it works only in Linux oprerating system. You shouldn't try to run it in Windows or Mac operating system. 

3 programs are required for getting both interactome map and GO annotation graphs. These are SAINTExpress, OmicsIntegrator, and Cytoscape.
